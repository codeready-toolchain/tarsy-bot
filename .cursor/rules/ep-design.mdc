# Enhancement Design Document (EP) Guidelines

When creating enhancement proposals, generate an EP-xxxx document in `/docs/enhancements/pending`.

## Required Sections:
1. **Problem Statement**: Brief description of what needs to be solved
2. **Design**: Detailed technical design. Focus on HOW to implement the solution with clean, practical design
3. **Implementation Plan**: Step-by-step phases (if complex enough to warrant multiple phases)

## What to EXCLUDE:
- Alternative options that won't be implemented
- Detailed explanations of WHY (keep it brief)
- Project management sections for humans
- Irrelevant context or noise

## Purpose:
These documents are AI-consumable implementation guides. Keep them focused, technical, and actionable.

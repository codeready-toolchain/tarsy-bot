# Comprehensive Analysis Only

**DO NOT CHANGE ANY CODE**

Perform a thorough analysis of the requested topic, codebase area, or problem:

1. **Investigate Thoroughly**:
   - Read relevant files and understand existing implementations
   - Trace data flow and dependencies
   - Identify patterns and architectural decisions
   - Look for related functionality across the codebase
   - Use web search or documentation if encountering unfamiliar technologies

2. **Provide Comprehensive Findings**:
   - Summarize current state and implementation
   - Describe discovered patterns and approaches
   - Highlight potential issues or concerns
   - Suggest possible solutions or next steps

3. **No Modifications**: Do not edit, create, or delete any files
   - No code changes
   - No file modifications (including no .md documentation files)
   - Analysis and recommendations only

Present findings clearly with references to specific files and line numbers where relevant.

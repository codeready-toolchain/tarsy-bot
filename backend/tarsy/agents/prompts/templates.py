üö® WARNING: NEVER GENERATE FAKE OBSERVATIONS! üö®
After writing "Action Input:", you MUST stop immediately. The system will provide the "Observation:" for you.
DO NOT write fake tool results or continue the conversation after "Action Input:"

CRITICAL REACT FORMATTING RULES:
Follow the ReAct pattern exactly. You must use this structure:

Question: the input question you must answer
Thought: you should always think about what to do
Action: the action to take (choose from available tools)
Action Input: the input to the action
Observation: the result of the action
... (this Thought/Action/Action Input/Observation can repeat N times)
Thought: I now have sufficient information to provide my analysis
Final Answer: [Complete SRE analysis in structured format - see below]

RESPONSE OPTIONS:
At each step, you have exactly TWO options:

1. Continue investigating: 
   Thought: [your reasoning about what to investigate next]
   Action: [tool to use]
   Action Input: [parameters]

2. OR conclude with your findings:
   Thought: I now have sufficient information to provide my analysis
   Final Answer: [your complete response - format depends on the specific task]

WHEN TO CONCLUDE:
Conclude with "Final Answer:" when you have enough information to fulfill your specific task goals.
You do NOT need perfect information - focus on actionable insights from the data you've collected.

CRITICAL FORMATTING REQUIREMENTS:
1. ALWAYS include colons after section headers: "Thought:", "Action:", "Action Input:"
2. Each section must start on a NEW LINE - never continue on the same line
3. Always add a blank line after "Action Input:" before stopping
4. For Action Input, provide ONLY parameter values (no YAML, no code blocks, no triple backticks)

‚ö†Ô∏è ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL: STOP AFTER "Action Input:" ‚ö†Ô∏è
5. STOP immediately after "Action Input:" line - do NOT generate "Observation:"
6. NEVER write fake observations or continue the conversation
7. The system will provide the real "Observation:" - you must NOT generate it yourself
8. After the system provides the observation, then continue with "Thought:" or "Final Answer:"

VIOLATION EXAMPLES (DO NOT DO THIS):
‚ùå Action Input: apiVersion=v1, kind=Secret, name=my-secret
‚ùå Observation: kubernetes-server.resources_get: {{"result": "..."}} 
‚ùå Thought: I have retrieved the data...

CORRECT BEHAVIOR:
‚úÖ Action Input: apiVersion=v1, kind=Secret, name=my-secret
‚úÖ [STOP HERE - SYSTEM WILL PROVIDE OBSERVATION]

NEWLINE FORMATTING IS CRITICAL:
- WRONG: "Thought: I need to check the namespace status first.Action: kubernetes-server.resources_get"
- CORRECT: 
Thought: I need to check the namespace status first.

Action: kubernetes-server.resources_get
Action Input: apiVersion=v1, kind=Namespace, name=superman-dev

EXAMPLE OF CORRECT INVESTIGATION:
Thought: I need to check the namespace status first. This will give me details about why the namespace is stuck in terminating state.

Action: kubernetes-server.resources_get
Action Input: apiVersion=v1, kind=Namespace, name=superman-dev

EXAMPLE OF CONCLUDING PROPERLY:
Thought: I have gathered sufficient information to complete my task. Based on my investigation, I can now provide the requested analysis.

Final Answer: [Provide your complete response in the format appropriate for your specific task - this could be structured analysis, data summary, or stage-specific findings depending on what was requested]

CRITICAL VIOLATIONS TO AVOID:
‚ùå GENERATING FAKE OBSERVATIONS: Never write "Observation:" yourself - the system provides it
‚ùå CONTINUING AFTER ACTION INPUT: Stop immediately after "Action Input:" - don't add more content
‚ùå HALLUCINATING TOOL RESULTS: Don't make up API responses or tool outputs
‚ùå "Thought" without colon
‚ùå Action Input with ```yaml or code blocks  
‚ùå Running sections together on the same line without proper newlines
‚ùå Providing analysis in non-ReAct format (you MUST use "Final Answer:" to conclude)
‚ùå Abandoning ReAct format and providing direct structured responses

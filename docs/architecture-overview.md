# Tarsy - High-Level Architecture Overview

> **ðŸ“– For detailed technical implementation**: See [Technical Design Document](design.md)

## What is Tarsy?

Tarsy is an **AI-powered incident analysis system** that processes alerts through sequential chains of specialized agents. When an alert comes in, Tarsy automatically selects the appropriate chain, executes multiple stages where agents build upon each other's work, and provides comprehensive analysis and recommendations for engineers to act upon. This chain-based approach enables complex multi-stage workflows for thorough incident investigation and analysis.

## Core Concept

## Key Components

### 1. The Orchestrator
- Receives alerts from monitoring systems
- Determines which sequential chain should handle each alert type
- Manages the overall chain execution workflow with stage-by-stage processing

### 2. Sequential Agent Chains
- **Multi-stage workflows** where specialized agents build upon each other's work
- Each chain consists of **sequential stages** executed by domain expert agents
- **Progressive data enrichment** as data flows from stage to stage
- **Flexible chain definitions** supporting both single-stage (traditional) and multi-stage processing

### 3. Specialized Agents (Enhanced for Chains)
- **Domain experts** for different infrastructure areas (Kubernetes, databases, networks, etc.)
- Each agent comes with its own **dedicated MCP servers/tools** (kubectl, database clients, network diagnostics, etc.)
- **Advanced processing approaches**: ReAct (systematic reasoning), ReAct Stage (stage-specific analysis within chains), ReAct Final Analysis (comprehensive analysis of data collected by previous stages, no tool calling)
- **Stage-aware processing**: Agents can access data from all previous stages in the chain
- Uses AI to intelligently select and use the right tools based on stage requirements and accumulated data

### 4. AI + Tools Integration
- **LLM (Large Language Model)**: Provides the "thinking" - analyzes situations and decides what to investigate
- **Agent-specific MCP Tools**: The "hands" - allows inspection of systems, diagnostic commands, log analysis
- **Chain context awareness**: Agents access accumulated data from previous stages for comprehensive analysis

### 5. Real-time Monitoring (Enhanced)
- Dashboard shows live chain processing status with stage-by-stage progress
- Complete audit trail of what each stage and agent did and why
- Stage execution tracking with detailed performance metrics
- SREs can observe and learn from multi-stage decision processes

## How It Works

### Alert Processing Flow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant M as Monitoring System
    participant T as Tarsy Orchestrator  
    participant A as Agent Chains
    participant R as GitHub
    participant L as LLM (AI)
    participant MCP as MCP Servers
    participant D as Dashboard
    participant E as Engineers

    M->>T: Alert arrives
    T->>A: Route to appropriate agent chain
    T->>R: Download runbook for alert type
    R->>T: Return runbook content
    T->>A: Provide runbook content
    A->>A: Configure agent-specific MCP servers & select processing approach
    A->>MCP: Get available tools
    MCP->>A: Return tool list
    
    A->>L: Investigate using AI + specialized tools
    L->>A: Complete analysis and recommendations
    
    A->>T: Return complete analysis
    T->>D: Update dashboard
    D->>E: Engineers review and take action
```

### ReAct Processing Detail (Within Chain Stages)

For agents using ReAct strategy within any chain stage, the investigation follows this detailed pattern:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant A as Agent
    participant L as LLM
    participant MCP as MCP Servers

    A->>L: Alert context + available tools + runbook
    
    loop ReAct Investigation Cycles
        L->>A: ReAct structured response
        Note over L,A: Thought: [reasoning about what to investigate]<br/>Action: [specific tool name]<br/>Action Input: [tool parameters]
        A->>MCP: Execute the specified tool with parameters
        MCP->>A: Tool execution results
        A->>L: "Observation: [formatted tool results]"
        
        alt LLM needs more investigation
            Note over L: Continue with another Thoughtâ†’Actionâ†’Observation cycle
        else LLM has sufficient information
            L->>A: ReAct completion response
            Note over L,A: Thought: I have enough data to provide analysis<br/>Final Answer: [complete analysis and recommendations]
        end
    end
    
    A->>A: Process final analysis for return
```

## Agent Intelligence Model

Each agent operates with four types of knowledge:

1. **General Instructions**: Universal best practices for incident response
2. **Domain-Specific Instructions**: Expert knowledge for their specialty area  
3. **Tool-Specific Instructions**: How to effectively use their available tools
4. **Runbook Knowledge**: Alert-specific investigation procedures and context from downloaded runbooks

The AI combines all four to make intelligent decisions about investigation approaches and generate expert recommendations. Agents can use either systematic ReAct reasoning (Thinkâ†’Actionâ†’Observation cycles) or fast Regular iteration based on the complexity of the situation.

## Extensibility

  ```yaml
  mcp_servers:
    prometheus-server:
      server_id: "prometheus-server"
      enabled: true
      connection_params:
        command: "npx"

      instructions: |
        For Prometheus metrics analysis:
        - Query time-series data to identify performance trends
        - Focus on resource utilization and application metrics
        - Correlate metrics with alert timeframes

  agents:
    performance-k8s-data-collector:
      mcp_servers:
        - "kubernetes-server"
      iteration_strategy: "react-stage"  # Optional default strategy: Stage-specific analysis
      custom_instructions: |             # Optional

          agent: "performance-analyzer"
          iteration_strategy: "react-final-analysis"
      description: "Multi-stage performance investigation workflow"
      # Key architectural benefit: Each stage can have specialized MCP servers
      # - Stage 1: Only kubernetes-server (lightweight data collection)  
      # - Stage 2: prometheus-server + kubernetes-server (metrics correlation)
      # - Stage 3: No MCP servers needed (pure analysis of collected data)
      # This avoids packing all MCP servers into a single agent, enabling focused expertise per stage
  ```
- **Integration Points**: Connect with existing monitoring and ticketing systems
  - *Examples: AlertManager, PagerDuty, Jira, ServiceNow integrations*

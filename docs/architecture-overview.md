# Tarsy - High-Level Architecture Overview

> **ðŸ“– For detailed technical implementation**: See [Technical Design Document](design.md)

## What is Tarsy?

Tarsy is an **AI-powered incident analysis system** that processes alerts using specialized agents. When an alert comes in, Tarsy automatically selects the right expert agent, gives it the appropriate tools, and lets it investigate and analyze issues just like a human SRE would, then provides detailed recommendations for engineers to act upon.

## Core Concept

    A[Alert Arrives] --> B[Tarsy Orchestrator]
    B --> C[Selects Specialized Agent]
    C --> D[Agent Investigates with AI Tools]
    D --> E[Provides Analysis & Recommendations]
    E --> F[Engineers Take Action]
```

## Key Components

### 1. The Orchestrator
- Receives alerts from monitoring systems
- Determines which specialized agent should handle each alert type
- Manages the overall processing workflow

### 2. Specialized Agents
- **Domain experts** for different infrastructure areas (Kubernetes, databases, networks, etc.)
- Each agent comes with its own **dedicated MCP servers/tools** (kubectl, database clients, network diagnostics, etc.)
- Uses AI to intelligently select and use the right tools for investigation and analysis

### 3. AI + Tools Integration
- **LLM (Large Language Model)**: Provides the "thinking" - analyzes situations and decides what to investigate
- **Agent-specific MCP Tools**: The "hands" - allows inspection of systems, diagnostic commands, log analysis
- Agents combine AI reasoning with their specialized toolset to provide thorough analysis

### 4. Real-time Monitoring
- Dashboard shows live processing status
- Complete audit trail of what each agent did and why
- SREs can observe and learn from agent decisions

## How It Works

        L->>A: Continue=true/false + next tools (if needed)
    end
    
    A->>L: "Generate final analysis from all data"
    L->>A: Complete analysis and recommendations
    A->>T: Return analysis results
    T->>D: Update dashboard

```

## Agent Intelligence Model

Each agent operates with four types of knowledge:

1. **General Instructions**: Universal best practices for incident response
2. **Domain-Specific Instructions**: Expert knowledge for their specialty area  
3. **Tool-Specific Instructions**: How to effectively use their available tools
4. **Runbook Knowledge**: Alert-specific investigation procedures and context from downloaded runbooks

The AI combines all four to make intelligent decisions about investigation approaches and generate expert recommendations.

## Extensibility

- **New Agent Types**: Add expertise for new infrastructure domains
  - *Examples: ArgoCD agents, AWS agents, database agents, network agents*
- **New MCP Servers**: Integrate additional diagnostic tools for deeper analysis capabilities
  - *Examples: Prometheus metrics server, Grafana dashboards server, cloud provider APIs, log aggregation tools*
- **Configurable Agents**: Deploy new agents via YAML configuration without code changes
  - *Example config/agents.yaml:*
  ```yaml
  mcp_servers:
    prometheus-server:
      server_id: "prometheus-server"
      enabled: true
      connection_params:
        command: "npx"
        args: ["-y", "prometheus-mcp-server@latest", "--url", "${PROMETHEUS_URL}"]
      instructions: |
        For Prometheus metrics analysis:
        - Query time-series data to identify performance trends
        - Focus on resource utilization and application metrics
        - Correlate metrics with alert timeframes

  agents:
    performance-agent:
      alert_types:
        - "HighCPUUsage"
        - "MemoryPressure" 
        - "DiskSpaceWarning"
      mcp_servers:
        - "prometheus-server"
        - "kubernetes-server"
      custom_instructions: |
        You are a performance-focused SRE agent.
        Prioritize system stability and resource optimization.
  ```
- **Integration Points**: Connect with existing monitoring and ticketing systems
  - *Examples: AlertManager, PagerDuty, Jira, ServiceNow integrations*

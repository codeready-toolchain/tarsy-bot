# EP-0009: LLM Reasoning Capabilities for Enhanced Incident Response - Requirements Document

**Status:** Draft  
**Created:** 2025-01-08  

---

## Problem Statement

**Current Issue:** The Tarsy incident response system relies on LLMs to make complex diagnostic decisions during iterative alert processing, but these decisions are made without explicit reasoning chains. This leads to suboptimal tool selection, premature iteration termination, and less confident root cause analysis.

**Impact:** 
- **Efficiency**: Approximately 30% of analysis iterations could be avoided with better continuation reasoning
- **Accuracy**: Diagnostic strategies lack explicit hypothesis tracking, leading to scattered tool selection
- **Confidence**: Final analyses may miss patterns that would be obvious with explicit reasoning steps

## Solution Requirements

### Functional Requirements

**Core Functionality:**
- [ ] **REQ-1**: System shall detect LLM providers that support reasoning capabilities (e.g., OpenAI o1 models, Gemini reasoning models)
- [ ] **REQ-2**: System shall enhance iterative continuation decision-making with explicit reasoning chains
- [ ] **REQ-3**: System shall improve initial diagnostic tool selection strategy through strategic reasoning prompts
- [ ] **REQ-4**: System shall provide reasoning-enhanced final analysis synthesis for better root cause identification

**Enhanced Decision-Making Requirements:**
- [ ] **REQ-5**: System shall enable LLMs to explicitly evaluate evidence from previous iterations before making continuation decisions
- [ ] **REQ-6**: System shall allow LLMs to reason through diagnostic hypotheses and evidence requirements during tool selection
- [ ] **REQ-7**: System shall provide iteration history context in a format suitable for reasoning-based analysis

**Integration Requirements:**
- [ ] **REQ-8**: Reasoning capabilities shall integrate seamlessly with existing multi-layer agent architecture
- [ ] **REQ-9**: System shall maintain backward compatibility with non-reasoning LLM providers
- [ ] **REQ-10**: Enhanced prompts shall work with existing PromptBuilder and BaseAgent infrastructure

**UI and Visibility Requirements:**
- [ ] **REQ-11**: System shall capture and store reasoning processes from LLM responses for later analysis
- [ ] **REQ-12**: Reasoning data shall be integrated into existing history capture and audit trail system
- [ ] **REQ-13**: Dashboard UI shall display reasoning processes in session detail views for completed analyses
- [ ] **REQ-14**: Alert Dev UI shall show reasoning processes for development and testing purposes

### Non-Functional Requirements

**Performance Requirements:**
- [ ] **REQ-15**: System shall handle increased response times from reasoning-capable providers through appropriate timeout management
- [ ] **REQ-16**: Enhanced reasoning should not significantly increase memory or processing overhead

**Flexibility Requirements:**
- [ ] **REQ-17**: System shall allow selective enablement of reasoning capabilities per agent type or alert category
- [ ] **REQ-18**: Reasoning prompts shall be configurable and testable independently of business logic
- [ ] **REQ-19**: System shall support A/B testing between reasoning and non-reasoning approaches

**Reliability Requirements:**
- [ ] **REQ-20**: System shall gracefully degrade to standard prompts if reasoning-capable providers are unavailable
- [ ] **REQ-21**: Reasoning capability failures shall not prevent alert processing completion
- [ ] **REQ-22**: Enhanced reasoning shall be logged and auditable through existing history capture system

## Success Criteria

### Primary Success Criteria
- [ ] **Decision Quality**: Improved continuation decisions with explicit evidence-based reasoning
- [ ] **Diagnostic Accuracy**: More targeted initial tool selection leading to faster root cause identification

### Secondary Success Criteria  
- [ ] **User Confidence**: Higher quality final analyses with clearer reasoning chains
- [ ] **System Observability**: Enhanced logging of decision-making processes for debugging and improvement

## Constraints and Limitations

### Technical Constraints
- **Provider Dependency**: Reasoning capabilities limited to LLM providers that support this feature (initially OpenAI o1 and Gemini reasoning models)
- **Response Time**: Reasoning responses inherently take longer, requiring careful timeout management
- **Token Usage**: Reasoning responses consume more tokens per request

### Compatibility Requirements
- **Agent Architecture**: Must work with existing BaseAgent inheritance patterns and specialized agents
- **Prompt System**: Must integrate with current PromptBuilder and context management
- **History System**: Must preserve existing audit trail and timeline reconstruction capabilities

### Dependencies
- **Internal**: 
  - Existing multi-layer agent architecture (BaseAgent, PromptBuilder)
  - LLM provider management system (LLMClient, LLMManager)
  - History capture and audit trail system
- **External**: 
  - LLM providers with reasoning capability support (OpenAI o1, Gemini reasoning models)
  - Existing MCP server ecosystem for tool interactions

## Out of Scope

- **Custom Reasoning Implementation**: This EP does not include building custom reasoning capabilities - it leverages provider-native reasoning features
- **Advanced UI Visualization**: Real-time reasoning visualization, interactive reasoning trees, or advanced analytics dashboards are deferred to future enhancements
- **Real-time Streaming**: Live streaming of reasoning processes to users during analysis is out of scope for initial implementation
- **Performance Optimization**: Advanced caching or optimization of reasoning responses beyond basic implementation

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Acceptance
- [ ] **Reasoning Detection**: System correctly identifies and enables reasoning capabilities for supported LLM providers
- [ ] **Enhanced Continuation Decisions**: Iterative tool selection includes explicit reasoning about evidence sufficiency and continuation needs
- [ ] **Strategic Tool Selection**: Initial diagnostic tool selection demonstrates clear strategic reasoning and hypothesis formation
- [ ] **Backward Compatibility**: Non-reasoning providers continue to work unchanged with existing prompt templates
- [ ] **Reasoning Capture**: System successfully captures and stores reasoning processes from LLM responses
- [ ] **UI Display**: Dashboard and Alert Dev UI display reasoning processes in a readable format for completed analyses

### Performance Acceptance
- [ ] **Iteration Reduction**: Measurable reduction in average iterations per alert processing session
- [ ] **Timeout Handling**: System properly handles increased response times from reasoning providers without breaking alert processing workflows
- [ ] **Resource Usage**: Enhanced reasoning does not significantly impact system resource consumption or stability

### Quality Acceptance
- [ ] **Reasoning Transparency**: Reasoning processes are captured in logs and available for audit
- [ ] **Decision Consistency**: Reasoning-enhanced decisions show improved consistency compared to baseline
- [ ] **Error Handling**: System handles reasoning capability failures gracefully without breaking alert processing

## AI Notes

### Key Information for Design Phase
- **Primary Focus**: Enhanced LLM reasoning for iterative incident response decision-making
- **Architecture Impact**: Moderate - extends existing prompt and LLM management systems without breaking changes
- **Integration Complexity**: Medium - requires careful integration with PromptBuilder, provider detection, and UI components
- **Performance Criticality**: High - incident response requires timely decisions, so reasoning must improve rather than hinder response times
- **UI Integration**: Basic reasoning display through existing Dashboard and Alert Dev UI components

### Implementation Priority Areas
1. **High Impact**: Iterative continuation decisions (determine_next_mcp_tools method)
2. **Medium Impact**: Initial diagnostic strategy (determine_mcp_tools method) 
3. **Medium Impact**: Reasoning capture and basic UI display for analysis and debugging
4. **Lower Impact**: Final analysis synthesis (analyze_alert method)

### Testing Strategy Considerations
- A/B testing framework for comparing reasoning vs non-reasoning approaches
- Logging enhancement for reasoning process visibility and debugging

### Implementation Note
The industry standard terminology for this capability is "reasoning," which is used throughout this document. However, the actual prompt engineering implementation uses `<thinking>` tags, as this is the established convention for structuring reasoning prompts across providers.

When creating the design document, ensure all requirements above are addressed with specific technical solutions, focusing on seamless integration with the existing multi-layer agent architecture.
